- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel Carneiro, a flight instructor that left aviation and started to dig into developing.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, experiencing, growing as human being, living a sustainable life, any kind of sustainable energy generation, eletric vehicles and so on.
Also interested on growing plants, and making my money to work for me, which means I enjoy the subject "investiments".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and making experiences with this awesome programming language!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nice projects, something that may help someone else. As a matter of fact, I'm dying to apply everything I've learned so far into someone else's
project (besides my own) and to be able to help, to make difference.
Another aspiration is to make my living from developing systems - yes, I'm a grown up and I need to make money! 🤣
- 📫 If you want to talk to me try to send me an e-mail: gabucarneiro@gmail.com.
